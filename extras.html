            <p>Remember to keep up date on the latest news in the world of programming! <br> The resources from back then may not help for present work!</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48AOOynnmqU">Also, don't rely on plain google searches / internet searches at least from after 2023. <br /> Most AI search algorithms used have now been poisoned and so is the rest of the modern internet.</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4gd-EpBlS0">Don't rely on AI to write things for you also. AI can't tell the difference between what is correct and what is not and only sends you information that it was able to gather and that information may not be what you are actually looking for.</a></p>

They have a core curriculum that is friendly to people that are new to coding and help them get used to the basics and they have thousands more of tutorials for different programming topics! They also offer free certification if you complete one of their core curriculums.</p>

They're like cheatsheets but a bit more expansive than one.</p>

We believe that the key to achieving this goal is to provide the easiest possible access to books."</i><br /><br />This is the mission that Z-Library goes by. Z-Library is, as part of what it's name goes by, a digital library where one can download copies of books and other forms of literature from. It has a lot of catalogue of books from fiction, to comics, to history books, to guides!<br /><br />You need to make an account to be able to download files and you're only able to download 10 files a day.</p>
