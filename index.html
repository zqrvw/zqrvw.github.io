        <h1>&zwnj; About</h1>
        <p><br /><b>|<i> Hello there! :D</i></b></p>
        <p>This presentation is all about hosting a website on github pages for anyone who wants to try setting up a website but don't have much means to use any premium website hosting services because let's face it, a lot of us here are probably not gonna pay for more features for wordpress or other sites like it any time soon. Not to mention all the fees that you gotta do for a custom domain if you want your website to not look too shabby. The limited customization options that wordpress provides for free users can be stifling to those who want to do more so here's a way to do a little bit more but not <i>too</i> much.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="buttonBubble" id="toolsbox">
        <h1>&zwnj; Tools</h1>
        <p>All you really need to host a website on github pages is a github pages account, a github client, a device to store your repositories locally that the github client can access, an ID/code editor, annnnnd coding skills.</p>
        <p>Make sure to store your repositories in a place where other people are not able to mess with it! If you have your own personal computer whether it be a laptop, desktop, or something else that can run all that that's all the better.</p>
        <p>I use a portable version of the github client that I found on PortableApps.com and it has been working smoothly and it can be helpful to those who are not able to install the github client personally on their computer. I store it in my USB along with my repositories. The build of this version of the client however is not an official one promoted by PortableApps.com or Github. It's just builds that a few developers that have developed on there in the community forums.</p>
        <p>I used VSCode because it's convenient and I can also carry it on my USB and the account that I used to host this website was newly made just for this.</p>
        <p>All the art I did was made on Medibang Paint on my phone, sketches were done in Sketchbook (the app, not an actual sketchbook). Once I got my art on the PC, I cropped them in FireAlpaca.</p>

        <h1>&zwnj; Limitations</h1>
        <p>This website is not up to the scale that I wanted it to be because I was running out of time however I hope it at leasts shows enough of what one is able to do when it comes to hosting with Github Pages.</p>
        <p>DISCLAIMERS: </p>
        <p>     > If you're a free user, your website's repository will be public! Do not store your personal information in it! As a free user, to run your website on Github Pages, your repository must be public. It will not work if you set it to private.</p>
        <p>     > Github Pages can only run <b><i>STATIC</i></b> sites and not dynamic sites!</p>
        <p>     > Dynamic sites are websites that uses serverside services and languages such as SQL, PHP or Ruby. Static sites do not do that.</p>
        <p>     > Meaning websites for e-commerce for example are out of the table. Github Pages is primarily intended to display a creator's content such as a portfolio.</p>
        <p>     > Unless you already have a domain that you bought that you can integrate into the repository, your main website url will simply be <\username\>.github.io.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="buttonBubble" id="coolbox">
        <h1>&zwnj; Cool Things to Know!</h1>
        <p>Github Pages is mostly used by developers to host their own portfolio or resume. It's free and you wouldn't have to worry about paying for a domain.</p>
        <p>Another thing that people use Github Pages for is blogs! They have their own static site generator called Jekyll and it can be used by people who prefer to use markdown instead of coding in html. Setting it up may take a while though.</p>

            <p style="border: 2px dashed dodgerblue; padding: 15px; text-align: justify;">07/26/24 edit: Here. I unarchived the repo. I think you can dig out and make do with all the spaghetti here. Made this for last year intended to use as a project to showcase for an event in last semester's IT Week for college. I don't intend to improve on this more since nekoweb and neocities exist and they're more effective at allowing you to be able to host your own site for free rather than on github. Unless you want to seem professional and have a website as a resume/portfolio then I recommend github pages lmao. nekoweb and neocities are more for hobbyists than anything but at least with nekoweb/neocities you can run html5 games that you made for other people to play if you pay 5$/3$ a month respectively (nekoweb has more freedom by the way)(but just link them to your itch.io page instead for games man. things would just run easier.). Nekoweb has a pretty friendly community while neocities are more for people who have grown up with geocities and want something more "stable"??. Neocities is a recognized IP that has been going on for YEARS while nekoweb's still pretty new and opened up this year around feb or so. It's a passion project done by a group of friends and volunteers I'm assuming. I'm not active on the discord to know if that's correct. Not sure on the month but it was this year they opened stuff. Anyways, if only I got around to updating my shit lol but it's hard when I don't really have a personal computer to use anytime for whatever unlike most people. My USB has just been my main pc but man there's only little you can do and a phone can't always be used for terminal related bullcrap which I want. Oh alas what horrible woes /s /nsrs. I should end my yapping, every platform I touch that people irl can't see just turns into a wall of text apparently like sydney's announcements in camp here and there. how in the abosolute fuck you people find my shit comprehensible and fine is beyond me, it's like you guys are happy to look at garbage, a bunch of racoons /aff /lh /nsrs (as always thanks for putting up with all the mentally ill infodumping /gen)<s>listen to ch&t by the way, it's good. <b><i>pleaaaaase?</i></b></s>. Anywaysanywaysanyways and anyhows, hope this was helpful?? Not sure how it would be helpful for you though genuinely, kinda curious. There are better ways to do the CSS and js here anyways. very rudimentary shit here and you can figure out easily why. My ass just got used to using flex and flexbox but grid turns out to be much helpful for most basic stuff it turns out :p those people who said web 3.0 ruined things were right about it.</p>

            <p class="quickHighlight">This is just a very quick edit just in case you have not read the README file in the repository, this is just gonna be a copy of that.</p>
            <p>05/03/24, 2:58 pm edit: This thing is incomplete. I haven't set up the proper media queries and resolutions for some things so the website looks unfinished in some aspects with text trailing off boxes in some instances but I hope it's enough to show that I have done some web development that I can show.</p>
