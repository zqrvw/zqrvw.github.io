            <h2>&#32; &#32; Some resources that can help :D &#32; &#32;</h2>
            <p>03/05/2024, 3:14pm edit: Books and written tutorials are better because people don't<br />always have access to quick and fast internet for solutions! And also video tutorials are<br />slow and are not ideal if you need to fix a problem quickly. I have put some digital<br />libraries here hoping to promote picking up programming and IT-educational books for<br />people who want to really get into programming and IT in general as some people might thrive<br />in the field by learning through that. You can google search "Recommended books in [insert topic]" too if you want book recommendations before you start searching in something like<br />Z-Library or Anna's Archive.</p>
            <p>03/05/2024, 3:20pm edit: The green text below lead to youtube videos on the state of AI<br />and Google Searching because I want people to not rely on them <u><b>wholely</b></u>. Please.<br />Misinformation and disinformation is bad and annoying.</p>
            <p>Remember to keep up date on the latest news in the world of programming! <br> The resources from back then may not help for present work!</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48AOOynnmqU">Also, don't rely on plain google searches / internet searches for answers, at least from after 2023. <br /> Most search algorithms now use AI like ChatGPT to give users results and the search results have become unreliable because it favors ads rather than giving you information you need.</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4gd-EpBlS0">Don't rely on AI to write things for you also. AI can't tell the difference between what is correct and what is not and only sends you information that it was able to gather and that information may not be what you are actually looking for. Disinformation has worsened because of AI now.</a></p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="description">A website that I would recommend for absolute beginners! They have a core curriculum that is friendly to people that are new to coding and help them get used to the basics and they have thousands more of tutorials for different programming topics! They also offer free certification if you complete one of their core curriculums.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="description">It has 48 books on different programming languages from languages for web development e.g. HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL to languages for software development e.g. C++, C, C#, Python, Java and more! <br /><br />The books can be lengthy and is aimed more for people who are familiar with how programming works but they can be great uses for reference if you can't access the internet! They're like cheatsheets but a bit more expansive than one.</p>

                    <p class="description">A commonly used resource and reference for web development in online developer circles, almost like if it's a cheatsheet. If you ask on a forum where you can learn web development better this is one of the top mentioned sources. It also covers guides on HTTP, web API's, web extensions, and web techonology in general.</p>

We believe that the key to achieving this goal is to provide the easiest possible access to books."</i><br /><br />This is the mission that Z-Library goes by. Z-Library is, as part of what it's name goes by, a digital library where one can download copies of books and other forms of literature from. It has a lot of catalogue of books from fiction, to comics, to history books, to guides!<br /><br />You need to make an account to be able to download files and you're only able to download 10 files a day.</p>

It searches both books and research papers. You can download files through their slow download links for free. Fast downloads are only available to donating members.</p>
