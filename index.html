        <h1>&zwnj; About</h1>
        <p><br /><b>|<i> Hello there! :D</i></b></p>
        <p>This presentation is all about hosting a website on github pages for anyone who wants to try setting up a website but don't have much means to use any premium website hosting services because let's face it, a lot of us here are probably not gonna pay for more features for wordpress or other sites like it any time soon. Not to mention all the fees that you gotta do for a custom domain if you want your website to not look too shabby. The limited customization options that wordpress provides for free users can be stifling to those who want to do more so here's a way to do a little bit more but not <i>too</i> much.</p>

        <h1>&zwnj; Tools</h1>
        <p>All you really need to host a website on github pages is a github pages account, a github client, a device to store your repositories locally that the github client can access, an ID/code editor, annnnnd coding skills.</p>
        <p>Make sure to store your repositories in a place where other people are not able to mess with it! If you have your own personal computer whether it be a laptop, desktop, or something else that can run all that that's all the better.</p>
        <p>I use a portable version of the github client that I found on PortableApps.com and it has been working smoothly and it can be helpful to those who are not able to install the github client personally on their computer. I store it in my USB along with my repositories. The build of this version of the client however is not an official one promoted by PortableApps.com or Github. It's just builds that a few developers that have developed on there in the community forums.</p>
        <p>I used VSCode because it's convenient and I can also carry it on my USB and the account that I used to host this website was newly made just for this.</p>
        <p>All the art I did was made on Medibang Paint on my phone, sketches were done in Sketchbook (the app, not an actual sketchbook). Once I got my art on the PC, I cropped them in FireAlpaca.</p>

        <h1>&zwnj; Limitations</h1>
        <p>This website is not up to the scale that I wanted it to be because I was running out of time however I hope it at leasts shows enough of what one is able to do when it comes to hosting with Github Pages.</p>
        <p>DISCLAIMERS: </p>
        <p>     > If you're a free user, your website's repository will be public! Do not store your personal information in it! As a free user, to run your website on Github Pages, your repository must be public. It will not work if you set it to private.</p>
        <p>     > Github Pages can only run <b><i>STATIC</i></b> sites and not dynamic sites!</p>
        <p>     > Dynamic sites are websites that uses serverside services and languages such as SQL, PHP or Ruby. Static sites do not do that.</p>
        <p>     > Meaning websites for e-commerce for example are out of the table. Github Pages is primarily intended to display a creator's content such as a portfolio.</p>
        <p>     > Unless you already have a domain that you bought that you can integrate into the repository, your main website url will simply be <\username\>.github.io.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="buttonBubble" id="coolbox">
        <h1>&zwnj; Cool Things to Know!</h1>
        <p>Github Pages is mostly used by developers to host their own portfolio or resume. It's free and you wouldn't have to worry about paying for a domain.</p>
        <p>Another thing that people use Github Pages for is blogs! They have their own static site generator called Jekyll and it can be used by people who prefer to use markdown instead of coding in html. Setting it up may take a while though.</p>
